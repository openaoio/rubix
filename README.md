# Rubix

### A rubix cube simulation library

#### Done (i.e. In testing)

* Rubix cube data representation
* Visual representations of the cube
* Rubix cube transformation algorithms (face rotations)
* Batch move execution
* Random scrambling by seed value
* Unscrambling by seed value
* Builds as shared library

#### In Development:

* Rubix cube cube solution algorithm implementation

#### Down the road:

* Integration with my python shell/mathmatical expression resolver
* Save/Load state to/from hard drive

### How to build the tests (which include some demos):

Initialize and update submodules: `git submodule init && git submodule update`
Build with: `make test`
Run with: `./test`

Clean the directory with `make clean`

### How to actually use the library:

However you damn please, this code is open source
