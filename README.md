# Rubix

### A rubix cube simulation library

##### In progress

* Rubix cube data representations
* Visual representations of the cube
* Rubix cube transformation algorithms
* Rubix cube cube solution algorithm implementation

#### Down the road:

* Integration with my python shell/mathmatical expression resolver
* Save/Load state to/from hard drive

### How to build the tests:

Build with: `make`
Run with: `./test`

Not much will happen...

Clean the directory with `make clean`
